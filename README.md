# Pentesting-Live-Targets

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Go to 'Find a salesperson' page and insert `' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'` as the id on the URL. This will cause the website to sleep for 5 seconds signaling that the injection was successful.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Using two browsers, Google Chrome and Firefox. Log in on Google Chrome and sopy down the session ID, then on the Firefox browser, paste the copied session ID from Google Chrome onto the session ID from Firefox. After doing this, you will notice you will have admin privileges and can navigate around the site.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

The mistake the developer made is when you enter the wrong login, but the username exists, the error message "Log in was unsuccessful" appears to be bold. If the username does not exist, the error message would just be plain text.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-Site Scripting is demonstrated by entering the javascript code:`<script>alert('XSS');</script>` in the feedback section. Once the user opens the feedback page, it will activate the XSS attack.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Looking at the list of Salespeople, Lazy is fire for stealing and Testy is not public until SEPT 1. By entering their ID on the 'Find A Salesperson' page. I noticed that both Blue and Green site hides those two staff members' profile but the Red site doesn't.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery

By creating my own html form, I was able to change Ken Barker's information into something else. You must first run your html file, then target a salesperson by their id before changing their information.
